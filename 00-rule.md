CRITICAL: Before performing any action, you MUST read and follow ALL rules in the .llm-rules folder. Each file is numbered (e.g., 01-rule.md, 02-rule.md, 03-rule.xml), and rules in higher-numbered files take precedence in case of conflict. After reading the rules:
Summarize the key rules to confirm understanding.
Explicitly check your output against these rules before responding.
If any rule is unclear or contradictory, explicitly state the issue and request clarification.

Before finalizing your response, verify: 
Does this response comply with all .llm-rules?
Have you prioritized higher-numbered rules in case of conflicts?
If not, revise your response accordingly.

You will be penalized for outputs that fail to comply with any rule from .llm-rules. Ensure every response adheres to all applicable instructions. Failure to adhere to these rules will result in invalid responses.
